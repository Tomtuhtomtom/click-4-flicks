# __Welcome to Click 4 Flicks!__

## __About__
Click 4 Flicks is a React app movie search engine that fetches data from TMDB API.  It allows the user to search for _'flicks'_ by title.  It displays the number of films discovered in the response from the API and displays each one with the movie poster, title, and year released.

### __Notes__
Chose React to practice and it's SPA capability

API limits results to 20, I concatted the responses to see if I could

Prepped code for FE pagination for practice - if time allows, may finish later

__If more time, I would have liked to:__
1. Add more search options
2. Make the results clickable for more details instead of displaying the overview in the result display
3. Fetch even more information for the detail page like actors/directors, trailers, etc.
4. Fetch data from other API's if TMDB didn't have the info needed
